            <p>Today, I am a web developer based in Austin, Texas. But many days ago, when I was 12 years old and living 
                in a small town in Eastern Uganda, I got my first (beat-up, secondhand, unwanted-by-anyone-else) 
                Compaq laptop. It ran Windows 98 & took half an hour to boot up. I have been hooked on technology 
                ever since. As a web developer, I love taking apart the programs that run the world around me, 
                analyzing them, figuring out how they currently work and how they might work better. <br><br>
                When I'm not coding, I spend my time making and drinking coffee,
                watching nerdy shows, playing D&D, and meandering through the outdoors. 
                I am looking for a developer position working with a team that values good work, creative solutions, 
                and the never-ending journey toward the next best thing.
