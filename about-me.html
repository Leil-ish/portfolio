            <p>When I was 12 years old, I got my first (beat-up, secondhand, unwanted-by-anyone-else) Compaq laptop. It ran Windows 98, took half an hour to boot up, and ultimately died within months of becoming mine. During its life, I explored its every digital nook and cranny. After its death, I took it apart, gazing wonderingly at the tiny hills and valleys of its hardware. 

            I have been hooked on technology ever since. As a web developer, I love taking apart the programs that run the world around me, analyzing them, figuring out how they currently work and how they might work better. I love creating and selectively destroying my own work, finding ways to make it as efficient and effective as possible without sacrificing the artistry of the language and design. 
            
            This is my portfolio; a work in progress, as all my works are.
